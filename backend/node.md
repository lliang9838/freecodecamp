**NPM (Node Package Manager)**

----
- npm init
- npm whoami
    - npm adduser
- You can tell npm about your project in  a file called package.json
    - npm init --scope=<'username'>
- The first thing that most people do with npm is install a dependency. Dependencies are fetched from the registry, and unpacked in the 'node_modules' folder.
    - To install a module, use the `npm install <modulename>` command
- npm isn't just for installing stuff. It also shows you what you have installed (your dependencies)
    - ` npm ls `
- _npm test_
